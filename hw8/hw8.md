# Assignment	8:	The	Case	for	a	Programming	Language

## Background
### Company 
`Mintendo`, a start-up mobile-app company aims at offline games.
### Project
An achievement system in the game called `Bright Souls`. Specifically, each achievement will be fulfilled as soon as players finish collecting required items, including armors, weapons, killed monsters, etc. Note that sub-achievements have the potential forming a larger achievement. Additionally, this system should have the ability of adding more achievements as the game itself updates.
